Kobby is my Ghanaian “day name” because I was born on Tuesday (you can check your day name [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghanaian_name) too). 
I graduated from [KNUST](https://www.knust.edu.gh) in Ghana with a bachelor’s degree in Physics and a major in Electronics after which I was a Teaching and Research Assistant for a year. During this time, I met Machine learning and the journey begun.

Currently, I am a student in [(AIMS)](https://www.nexteinstein.org/) - [(AMMI)](www.aimsammi.org), Rwanda and more exciting, part of the first cohort and advised by Micha\"{e}l Defferrard. 
I’m mostly interested in Deep Learning, Graph Neural Networks, Causal inference and Machine Learning for Healthcare.

During the Fall Semester, I interned with [Marzyeh Ghassemi](http://www.marzyehghassemi.com/) at the University of Toronto and Vector Institute.
I like meeting and keeping professors, collaborators and friends close by. 
Outside academics and research, I love playing the Bass Guitar and sometimes piano in a band.
