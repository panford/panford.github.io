Kobby is my Ghanaian “day name” because I was born on Tuesday (you can check your day name [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghanaian_name) too). 
I graduated from [KNUST](https://www.knust.edu.gh) in Ghana with a bachelor’s degree in Physics and a major in Electronics after which I was a Teaching and Research Assistant for a year. During this time, I met Machine learning and the journey begun.

Currently, I am a student in [(AIMS](https://www.nexteinstein.org/) - [AMMI)](https://aimsammi.org/), Rwanda and more excitingly part of the first cohort and advised by [Michaël Defferrard](https://deff.ch/). 
I’m mostly interested in Deep Learning, Graph Neural Networks, Causal inference and Machine Learning for Healthcare.

During the Fall Semester, I interned with [Marzyeh Ghassemi](http://www.marzyehghassemi.com/) at the Vector Institute and was part of the ML4H and zgroup groups.
I like meeting and keeping [professors](https://www.flickr.com/photos/186506832@N03/albums/72157712707975707), [collaborators and friends](https://www.flickr.com/photos/186506832@N03/albums/72157712708189451) close by. 
Outside academics and research, I love playing the Bass Guitar and sometimes piano in a band.
